# Databricks-2026
In this project, you will build a **complete Data Lakehouse** from scratch using **Databricks** and the **Medallion Architecture**.

You will start with raw data and step by step transform it into clean, reliable, and business-ready datasets using the **Bronze, Silver, and Gold** layers. This is how modern data platforms are built in real companies.

You won’t just write code. You will design architecture, improve data quality, model data for analytics, and automate everything with pipelines and jobs.
